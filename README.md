Pretty cool password manager. Use it if you want.

Run the pwdManager.py with python3 only.
It works on local machine only.

First, create yourself an account to make sure nobody will have the access.
Generate a password with the generator, you can click untill you find the perfect one. 
Copy it in leafpad or something like that.
Register your password with the linked service.
Now you can access your password just by typing the name of the service you want.
